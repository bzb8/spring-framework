/**
 * A common interface defining methods for start/stop lifecycle control.
 * The typical use case for this is to control asynchronous processing.
 * <b>NOTE: This interface does not imply specific auto-startup semantics.
 * Consider implementing {@link SmartLifecycle} for that purpose.</b>
 * --
 * 定义 start/stop 生命周期控制方法的通用接口。其典型用例是控制异步处理。
 * 注意：此接口并不意味着特定的自动启动语义。请考虑为此目的实现 {@link SmartLifecycle}。
 *
 * <p>Can be implemented by both components (typically a Spring bean defined in a
 * Spring context) and containers  (typically a Spring {@link ApplicationContext}
 * itself). Containers will propagate start/stop signals to all components that
 * apply within each container, e.g. for a stop/restart scenario at runtime.
 * --
 * 可以由组件（通常是在 Spring 上下文中定义的 Spring bean）和容器（通常是 Spring {@link ApplicationContext} 本身）实现。
 * 容器会将 start/stop 信号传播到每个容器中应用的所有组件，例如，用于运行时的 stop/restart 方案。
 *
 * <p>Can be used for direct invocations or for management operations via JMX.
 * In the latter case, the {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter}
 * will typically be defined with an
 * {@link org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler.InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler},
 * restricting the visibility of activity-controlled components to the Lifecycle
 * interface.
 * --
 * 可用于直接调用或通过 JMX 进行管理操作。在后一种情况下，{@link org.springframework.jmx.export.MBeanExporter}
 * 通常使用{@link org.springframework.jmx.export.assembler.InterfaceBasedMBeanInfoAssembler}定义，从而将活动控制组件的可见性限制为生命周期接口。
 *
 * <p>Note that the present {@code Lifecycle} interface is only supported on
 * <b>top-level singleton beans</b>. On any other component, the {@code Lifecycle}
 * interface will remain undetected and hence ignored. Also, note that the extended
 * {@link SmartLifecycle} interface provides sophisticated integration with the
 * application context's startup and shutdown phases.
 *
 * 请注意，当前的 {@code Lifecycle} 接口仅在<b>顶级单例 Bean 上受支持<b>。在任何其他组件上，
 * {@code Lifecycle} 接口将保持未检测到状态，因此将被忽略。另请注意，扩展的 {@link SmartLifecycle} 接口提供了与应用程序上下文的启动和关闭阶段的复杂集成。
